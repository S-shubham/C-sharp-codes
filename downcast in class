downcast creates a subclass reference from base class

i first created a base class object and then downcasted it, and that caused an exception at runtime

next i created the subclass object and then upcasted it and then again downcasted from it and it worked

// in down casting subclass reference is created from the base class
using System;

namespace hello_world
{  

     class Program
    {
       
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
           pol ob=new pol();
           lol obj=ob;
           obj.name="shani";
          // going to perform up casting

          pol obj1=(pol)obj;
            obj1.sal=100;
          Console.WriteLine("the name is: "+obj1.name); 
          Console.WriteLine("your salary in millions is : "+obj1.sal);
          
          Console.ReadKey();
          
        }
    }
    class lol
    {
       public  string name;
    }

    class pol:lol
    {
        public int sal;

    }
    
}
