Checked opertor in c# tells if any overflow has occureed or not
if it has occureed then it will generate overflow exception

it deals with integral data only. it does not work with floating point numbers

- it has two versions
1) int c= checked (a*b);

here it checks a single expression

2) 
checked
{
...
...
}
in this case it checks all of the expressions and if any overflow has occurred it will throw exception

it works with these operators
++
--
+
-
(both unary and binary)
*
/

///////////////////
checking can be made to apply to all of the program using /checked+ in command line.
the setting can also be applied in visual studio

"unchecked" expression is used when we do not want to check certain expressions.

ex:- 
int y= unchecked (a*b);
