In C# data types are broadly divided into two type
1) predefined types
2) custom types

Predefined types are out general data types like int, char, float, bool etc.
Custom data types are user defined and they are created using Classes

predefined data types can be initialized using literals like:
int a=10
char c='c'
etc...................

but custom data types is initialized using "new" keyword

In c# all the data members or method inside a class can either work with instance or directly with class

so those members which does not depend upon instances are called static members and must be labelled as static
like main() function is static as no instance or object can invoke it 
rather it is invoked by class itself

Console is a class and it is declared static and hence all of its members are also static 
Instance of a console is never created, one console is shared across the whole application


////////////////////////example/////////////////////////////////////

// functions in c# 
// it can be declared outside the main function preferabely 

using System;

namespace hello_world
{   
     class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("what is the name of your panda :");
            string namep=Console.ReadLine();
            panda obj=new panda(namep);
            Console.WriteLine("what is the name of your another panda : ");
            string sec=Console.ReadLine();
            panda obj2=new panda(sec);

            panda.population();

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    class panda
    {
        string name;
        static int count;
        public panda(string s) { name=s; count=count+1;}
        public static void population() {Console.WriteLine("the population of panda is : "+count);}


    }
}

Here in the above code if i try to access name member it will pop error as it has not been declared public
so no other class can access it
