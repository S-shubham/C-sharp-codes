IN  C#,
implicit converson occurs only if these two conditions are satisfied
1) the compiler can guarantee that they will always succeed
2) no information is lost in conversion

Explicit conversion takes place under these conditions
1) the compiler cannot guarantee that they will always succeed
2) some inforamtino might get lost

ex;
int a=100;
float b=a;  (implicit)

short x=(short)a  (explicit)

if compiler can guarantee that they will always fail then both conversion is prohibited
